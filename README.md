## Time Display
Create an ASP.NET Core app that finds the current date and time, formats it, and displays it on the front-end.

You can access the current time with C#'s DateTime class.

    DateTime CurrentTime = DateTime.Now;

In Terms of formatting the Date and Time there are ample resources avaliable and that is also part of this challenge is discovering those resources for yourself. This may be a proper time to practice that google-fu :)
